# Database: Using PlanetScale PostgreSQL
# PlanetScale now supports native PostgreSQL connections.
# The code uses pg (PostgreSQL client) which works with Cloudflare Workers via TCP connections.
# 
# Note: Database migrations should be run separately, not in the Worker.
# Run migrations manually or via a separate migration process.

# Environment variables will be set via GitHub Secrets:
# - DATABASE_URL (PlanetScale PostgreSQL connection string)
# - BETTER_AUTH_SECRET
# - BETTER_AUTH_URL
# - GITHUB_CLIENT_ID
# - GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET
